        Question: How will your users understand the content of the project?
        <br>
        They will know that the content is just other travelers that can be contacted.
    </p>

        Question: How will your users understand the primary objectives?
        <br>
        The users will know that the app really serves as a means to see the people around you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Question: How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are
        their experience levels with the type of media you are creating?
        <br>
        They will know how it works because I think they will be very used to this type of app.
        It can be almost tinder-like. But no swiping left or right--you can just see everyone and decide who
        to talk to.
