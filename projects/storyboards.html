      I tried out two ideas in class for the storyboard. The first was
      an app that allows <br>people to rent or borrow items from people near them. I
      used an example of a person <br>traveling in Paris who need to get to a place accross town.
      Taxis and Uber are expensive, if only he had a bike. <br>So he opens the app, sees someone near him
      offering to rent out their bike--so he rents it from them!<br> He then uses it to go to the place and
      everything works great.
      <br><br>
      My second storyoard is a similar situation--a traveler in Paris--but who is looking to get to<br> know people
      and to get a meal. So he checks his app and posts on it that he is a hungry<br> traveler looking to eat some dinner
      and meet people. He gets an alert that someone has invited him to dinner! <br>The next scene he is sitting
      with a local family eating dinner and absorbing their culture.
      <br><br>
      I have decided to go with a different-somewhat similar--idea for my project. I thought the
      market<br> for these ideas were too small--not many people<br> want to rent their stuff out and even fewer are
      willing to invite a stranger to their home. <br>But after doing this and talking to people I came up with
      the idea to have an app that showed other <br>travelers in the area. Kinda like a tinder for travelers trying to
      meet up. You can open it and see other travelers <br>within x-miles from you and message them to see if they wanna hang out!
