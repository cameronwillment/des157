    <h1>Background Research</h1>
    <h2>Peerby</h2>
    <p>
      This application pretty much does the same thing I am trying to do
      however it is not very popular. On iOS there are 2 reviews, on android it does
      a bit better with about 250 reviews. Still very small and the reviews are poor
      so I believe there is still a market gap that needs filled. A big complaint is
      that there doesn't not seem to be many people using the app so not many chances
      to borrow items from neighbors. I think this is where marketing comes in. It is key
      to get a community on board for it to be adopted. Another complaint is that
      you have to sign in and give your information just to see who around you is using it.
      This may be important for saftey though because you don't want just anyone seeing what
      items his neighbor has. I think a better way to do this may be to 'friend' neighbors
      before seeing what they have. I think my idea of the app is a little more community focused
      so it is not quite share your items with everyone, but just a way to share with friends or at least
      people you somewhat trust. I think there should be an added raiting system for the item, the seller and the
      buyer as well. The interface of this app is very nice though.

    <h2>Loanables</h2>
    <p>
      Loanables is a website that does the same thing I am trying to do. It seems very outdated though
      so I dont think many people are using it. I also think a mobile app is a much better
      platform for this. Here there is no rating system or even a good way to see who
      you are giving to or renting from. I think it is important to connect to facebook
      because if you can see someones facebook profile than you can verify who they are and it provides
      security so no one is going to steal the object. I also think an important thing is to have a credit
      card connected so if you steal the item your card is charged automatically.
