    <h1>Topic Brainstorm</h1>
    <h2>Community Marketplace App</h2>
    <p>
      An application where users can post items that people nearby
      can use for a fee. For instance you dont have a vacume but your neighbor
      does--you can rent it from them for whatever fee they say. This has many
      applications and has the benefit of reducing cosumption, waste and
      strengthing community bonds.
