    <h1>Topic Research</h1>
    <h2>Community Marketplace App</h2><br>
    <p>
      The idea of renting your stuff out is not new. There are many apps that
      attempt this. They seem to all fail (but there is a succesful trend in Europe).
      One of the main reasons for the failing apps is that there is not a large community
      using the app so there is no one renting anything near you. That seems to be the failure
      for a lot of the ones in the US. People generally turn to craigslist as it has
      a huge amount of users. Then there are the problems that come when you rent your
      stuff out like people braking your things. That can be remedied with security deposits but still
      presents a major problem. There are also many legal concerns to consider. For instance
      if someone uses your product and gets injured you may be liable. Another legal concern is that you
      have to pay taxes on this additional source of income. Furthermore, if you are making a living off renting
      your things then you could be considered to be operating a business and be forced to pay the appropriate
      taxes. All this seems to be quite a hassle, but I think my idea fixes some of these issues.
      First, to sign up for the app you have to give up your right to sue the lender. As far as the community is concerned
      I think the best way to accomplish this is to focus on neighborhoods because everyone will pressure
      their neighbors to get the app. Also, when it is your neighbor borowing the stuff you may be less concerned
      with them stealing or braking it. While doing research I came accross an app called Nextdoor, which is basically
      a private social network for your neighbors. I think I would incorporate this. It is a good way
      for a community to share concerns like safety--if there was a break in-- and complaint--like noisy
      neighbors. It is also good if you want to advertise a dog walking service to your neighbors or ask for a house sitter.
      I think my idea is to have a general feed for these purposes, and have a separate "rent" button that lets you see and post
      whatever stuff your neighbors are renting or you are renting. I think focusing on a communty makes this
      a much more useful app. For instance maybe your dorm wants to have a place where they can all communicate and share things or share food.
      On the Free and for Sale page for davis on facebook people are selling food that they made, I think more people would do this if they had an app
      like the one I am proposing. I think I am going to broaden my app so that it incorporates all types of things a neighborhood app could use.
      Even things like neighborhood events and such.
