    <h1>Topic Choice</h1>
    <h2>
    The topic I have chosen is to create an app that allows users to rent items
    with their neighbours. Users can upload a picture of their lawnmower, for example
    and other users can rent that product from them. Other apps have tried this, but I think
    the key with mine is that it allows people to form groups where only other people
    in their group can see their add. This fostors a sense of community and gets rid of
    concerns about letting the public know what things you have.
