        Chess Clock!
      </h1>
    </section>
    <article>
        For my studio4 I decided to make a chess clock that was
        designed for mobile use because I play speed chess and I like the  idea
        of having access to a chess clock from anyone's phone. I made a simple design
        of two circles for the timers and a square pause button so that it stood out.
        Once you press the pause it goes away and is replaced with two small circles for resuming
        and restarting. I really like this design because it is simple and effective. What I think is
        good as well is that the one timer is upside down so that the phone can be placed on a table
        and the two players will see the clock appropriately. What can be improved is the addition of sounds
        that click when the timers are hit, and a moving color wheel surrounding the clocks that goes from
        green to red to indicate the player's time is running out.

        Pocket full of music!

        For my studio3 I decided to display my favorite albums. I have them
        in my phone and therefore in my pocket at all times, and I figured
        it would give a good insite as to who I am or at least what I enjoy.
        I displayed them in a simple 3x3 matrix form and set the opacity down.
        I made it so when you hover over each album it expands and resets opacity to
        1 so it appears to jump out at you. I also made it so that when you click
        on an album it flips over and gives you a breif description of the album or
        what I enjoy about it. It also plays the song and then pauses when you click
        it again to flip it back.

        A Review of Google application form
      </h1>

        I do not use mnay form websites in my life, but when applying
        to jobs it defeinitley has come up a bit. It is probably the worst part of
        applying to jobs in my opinion as it is so tedious and annoying. But when
        applying to google I wasn't as pained. Their form was simple, clean and
        most importantly smart. It would remember what you imputed for different jobs
        and would adjust the form based on information you provided. It also
        would not lose all your information when you lef the page which I thought
        was great. I also like the look of it. Quite simple and clean.

        A Review of Reddit's interface
      </h1>
    </section>
    <article>
        Although not the prettiest and most modern of designs,
        I am quite pleased with reddit’s interface. It is very simple
        and get straight to the point--links. Basically just an endless list
        of links. Reddit is a site where users post links to other sites and the
        links get sorted by users so you are always seeing what everyone things
        is best first. Just a short description of the link and a thumbnail
        (if you have that setting on) is all you see at first.
        Once you click on a link it takes you to a new view that is dominated by
        comments. These comments are also sorted by popularity, which means you
        see the best comments first. Whats different is that it allows for
        conversations by not only sorting the original comments, but also all the
        replies to those comments. So you also see the best reply, the best reply
        to that, and so on. This system really allows for great conversations
        not seen on other forums. Reddit’s interface is interesting because it
        look quite daunting to new comers and I almost think that is on purpose.
        It seems that users like to think of reddit as a community so by requiring
        some time to acclimate to the interface, they are weeding out people that
        are not as invested in the site.
